abstract = {In this work we present a genetic algorithm based method to design a mechatronic system. First, we present the sequential approach where we optimize the geometry of the mechanism, for a given path, and then solve the dynamic problem where we take into account the characteristics of the motor along with the inertia of the different links of the mechanism. Several types of objective functions are tested. We show, however, that this sequential method does not yield acceptable results for the dynamic behavior due to the fact that the geometry is assumed fixed when optimizing the dynamics. This led us to formulate a global optimization problem where all the parameters of the mechanism are considered simultaneously. The problem is then presented as a multi-objective optimization one where the geometry and the dynamics are considered simultaneously. The obtained solutions form what is called a "Pareto front" and they are analyzed for several different design conditions. This paper also shows the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach over the single-objective one. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A typical mechatronic problem (modelling,$\backslash$nidentification, and design) entails finding the best$\backslash$nsystem topology as well as the associated parameter$\backslash$nvalues. The solution requires concurrent and integrated$\backslash$nmethodologies and tools based on the latest theories.$\backslash$nThe experience on natural evolution of an engineering$\backslash$nsystem indicates that the system topology evolves at a$\backslash$nmuch slower rate than the parametric values. This paper$\backslash$nproposes a two-loop evolutionary tool, using a hybrid$\backslash$nof genetic algorithm (GA) and genetic programming (GP)$\backslash$nfor design optimisation of a mechatronic system.$\backslash$nSpecifically, GP is used for topology optimization,$\backslash$nwhile GA is responsible for finding the elite solution$\backslash$nwithin each topology proposed by GP. A memory feature$\backslash$nis incorporated with the GP process to avoid the$\backslash$ngeneration of repeated topologies, a common drawback of$\backslash$nGP topology exploration. The synergic integration of GA$\backslash$nwith GP, along with the memory feature, provides a$\backslash$npowerful search ability, which has been integrated with$\backslash$nbond graphs (BG) for mechatronic model exploration. The$\backslash$nsoftware developed using this approach provides a$\backslash$nunified tool for concurrent, integrated, and autonomous$\backslash$ntopological realisation of a mechatronic problem. It$\backslash$nfinds the best solution (topology and parameters)$\backslash$nstarting from an abstract statement of the problem. It$\backslash$nis able to carry out the process of system$\backslash$nconfiguration realization, which is normally performed$\backslash$nby human experts. The performance of the software tool$\backslash$nis validated by applying it to mechatronic design$\backslash$nproblems.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel multimodal evolutionary$\backslash$noptimisation algorithm for the complex problem of$\backslash$nconcurrent and integrated design of a mechatronic$\backslash$nsystem, with the objective of realising the best$\backslash$ntopology and the best parameters from a multicriteria$\backslash$nviewpoint and with different preferences. The$\backslash$nassociated search space can be large and complex due to$\backslash$nthe existence of different classes of configurations,$\backslash$npossible topologies, and the parameter values of the$\backslash$nelements. The proposed algorithm efficiently explores$\backslash$nthe search space to find several elite configurations$\backslash$nfor different preferences, with more detailed$\backslash$ncompetition by incorporating the domain knowledge of$\backslash$nexperts and considering some criteria that are not$\backslash$nincluded in the course of regular evolutionary$\backslash$noptimisation.

For each topology, a genetic$\backslash$nalgorithm-based optimisation is performed to find an$\backslash$nelite representative of the topology. The elites will$\backslash$ncompete with each other to become the best design. A$\backslash$nstrategy of restricted competition selection is$\backslash$nemployed in the competition of topologies, with the aim$\backslash$nof finding alternative elites from which the one that$\backslash$nbest satisfies the customer preference may be chosen.$\backslash$nThe designer may incorporate a higher level competition$\backslash$nbetween elites in order to obtain the global optimum.},

abstract = {A design methodology for mechatronic vehicles is presented. With multidisciplinary optimization (MDO) methods, strongly coupled mechanical, control and other subsystems are integrated as a synergistic vehicle system. With genetic algorithms (GAs) at the system level, the mechanical, control and other relevant parameters can be optimized simultaneously. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed design methodology for mechatronic vehicles, it is used to resolve the conflicting requirements for ride comfort, suspension working spaces and unsprung mass dynamic loads in the optimization of half-vehicle models with active suspensions. Both deterministic and random road excitations, both rigid and flexible vehicle bodies and both perfect measurement of full state variables and estimated limited state variables are considered. Numerical results show that the optimized vehicle systems based on the methodology have better overall performance than those using the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller. It is shown that the methodology is suitable for complex design optimization problems where: (1) there is interaction between different disciplines or subsystems; (2) there are multiple design criteria; (3) there are multiple local optima; (4) there is no need for sensitivity analysis for the optimizer at the system level; and (5) there are multiple design variables. © 2005 Taylor \& Francis.},

abstract = { Soft computing techniques, e.g., neural networks, fuzzy inference, evolutionary computation, and chaos theory, have been applied to a wide variety of control systems in industry because of their control capability and flexibility. They are also powerful to handle the complicated mechatronic systems with various nonlinearities which are difficult to model using mathematical formulas. In order to achieve the system identification of unknown structured mechatronic systems, This work presents a novel evolutionary algorithm using genetic algorithms (GAs), where the optimal mathematical structure of plant mechanisms and the combination of parameters can be autonomously determined by means of the optimization ability of the GA. The effectiveness of the proposed identification has been verified by experiments with comparative studies, using the typical mechanical systems with velocity controller.},

This model includes important dynamic characteristics of tethered spacecraft in orbit, namely the nonlinear coupling between tether deformations, rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, a reeling mechanism, and orbital dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

abstract = {This paper suggests a unified and automated design methodology for synthesizing designs for multi-domain systems, such as mechatronic systems. A multi-domain dynamic system includes a mixture of electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, and/or thermal components, making it difficult use a single design tool to design a system to meet specified performance goals. The multi-domain design approach is not only efficient for mixed-domain problems, but is also useful for addressing separate single-domain design problems with a single tool. Bond graphs (BGs) are domain independent, allow free composition, and are efficient for classification and analysis of models, allowing rapid determination of various types of acceptability or feasibility of candidate designs. This can sharply reduce the time needed for analysis of designs that are infeasible or otherwise unattractive. Genetic programming is well recognized as a powerful tool for open-ended search. The combination of these two powerful methods is therefore an appropriate target for a better system for synthesis of complex multi-domain systems. The approach described here will evolve new designs (represented as BGs) with ever-improving performance, in an iterative loop of synthesis, analysis, and feedback to the synthesis process. The suggested design methodology has been applied here to three design examples. The first is a domain-independent eigenvalue placement design problem that is tested for some sample target sets of eigenvalues. The second is in the electrical domain - design of analog filters to achieve specified performance over a given frequency range. The third is in the electromechanical domain - redesign of a printer drive system to obtain desirable steady-state position of a rotational load. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
