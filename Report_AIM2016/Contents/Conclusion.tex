In this work, geometric programming is introduced to replace genetic algorithm in solving an optimization problem of mechatronic product design in order to increase design efficiency. The general approach for constructing constraints and objectives is presented, verified in a design case where a system containing a servo motor and planetary gears under certain load seeks to have smallest volume. As a result of proposed method, the computational time has significantly decreased while design optimal is still yielded.

In future,
